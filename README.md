### Hello World

My name is Daniel. I'm currently a Software Developer at Adobe, and I love to bring my ideas to life. 

While looking through my profile, you're going to find various projects I've worked on. Hopefully you can get some value out of them, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

### What brings you here?

***Looking to check out projects I've worked on?***  
:point_right: If you're not here to check out anything specific, the pinned repos are always a good place to start. 

***Looking to see what I'm currently working on?***  
:point_right: Most of my development time is spent at work, but in my free time, I'm enjoying working on a visual novel with some of my friends. (Sorry, it's closed source)  

***Looking for fun facts about me?***  
:point_right: I have a bunch of them, but my most fun fact is that I love to sing and write songs about ramen.

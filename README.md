### Hello World <img src="https://github.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/blob/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="24px"></h2>

My name is Daniel. I'm currently a Senior in Software Engineering at Iowa State University, and I love to bring my ideas to life. 

While looking through my profile, you're going to find various projects I've worked on. Hopefully you can get some value out of them, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

### What brings you here?

***Looking to check out projects I've worked on?***

***Looking to see my experience?***  
:point_right: Check out my [resume](https://danielbarnes175.github.io/resume/).

***Looking for fun facts about me?***  
:point_right: I have a bunch of them, but my most fun fact is that I love to sing and write songs about ramen.

### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel. I'm currently a Senior in Software Engineering at Iowa State University, and I love to bring my ideas to life. 

While looking through my profile, you're going to find various projects I've worked on. Hopefully you can get some value out of them, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
